- 👋 Hi, I’m Jona
- 👀 I’ve always been fascinated by development and thrive on challenges, especially digging deep to get to the root of an issue.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js, TailWind.css and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more frontend projects and learning new techniques. 
- 📫 Please get in touch through my Discord or my email.
- 😄 Pronouns: J. O. N. A.
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me strumming my guitar, writing songs, or getting lost in a good book.
